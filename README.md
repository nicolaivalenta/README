# README
Hey, I'm Nicolai, and I'm an undergraduate student at UT Austin studying Economics in the Liberal Arts Honors (LAH/Plan I) college. 
I'm interested in pursuing a career in finance or consulting upon graduation, although I may choose to go to law school first.
One particular sector of finance where I'd like to gain more knowledge is quant finance. 
That is why I'm here; I think GitHub will give me a lot of exposure to interesting computer science and data science projects that I can become involved in and learn from.
